##### This is my first 2D game, still in development. 
##### I'm currently learning how to develop games in C++ using the SDL library. 
##### This was made with sublime-text. To run the game, open bin/Debug directory                    
##### inside the folder of the game, and open main.exe. There is                      
##### a project file in sublime-text in the "2D Game" folder.                    
##### To open it, install sublime-text3 if you haven't yet, and open                  
##### the "Physics 2D Platformer SDL" file. There you will be abble to see            
##### all the src and hpp files, and you can modify the code if you want and          
##### build the application with the new changes.

The source files are all in the "src" folder, while the header files
are all in the "hpp" folder. All the codes were written in C++.
To compile the code, you must have the SDL2 library installed in
your computer, as well as SDL_image.h and SDL_mixer.h. The sublime-project file
is already configured to find this libraries in your computer and link them to
compiler.
